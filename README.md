## General Information
This project examines factors that contribute to a patient's survival in the hospital. Supervised machine learning models were evaluated to determine the most accurate model for survival prediction. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for cause of mortality among admitted hospital patients. In this dataset, there are various factors given, which are involved when a patient is hospitalized. On the basis of these factors, predict whether the patient will survive or not.
