## General Information
This project will be used for doctors in hospitals to predict patients survival rates by using supervised machine learning model. 
The predictors of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients remain poorly characterized. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among admitted patients.
In this dataset, there are various factors given, which are involved when a patient is hospitalized. On the basis of these factors, predict whether the patient will survive or not.


## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Flask
- Tableau
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
